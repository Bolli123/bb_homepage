## ðŸš€ My homepage

I created this homepage to showcase my personal projects. I decided to use no external libraries to challenge myself into learning new things. This whole project went smootly and I finally got over my irrational fear of display: flex, I always used grids in the past to accomplish the same things or just pure spite. But it turns out flex tends to be more ...flexible.

## What I used
* Gatsby
* Typescript
* SASS
* Docker
